# WebSockets

WebSocket is a computer [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol), providing [simultaneous two-way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-duplex) communication channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC [6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) in 2011. The current specification allowing web applications to use this protocol is known as WebSockets. It is a living standard maintained by the WHATWG and a successor to The WebSocket API from the W3C.

WebSocket is distinct from [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) used to serve most webpages. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket "is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries", thus making it compatible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket [handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshake_(computing)) uses the [HTTP Upgrade header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/1.1_Upgrade_header)[3] to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

The WebSocket protocol enables full-duplex interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server. The communications are usually done over TCP port number 443 (or 80 in the case of unsecured connections), which is beneficial for environments that block non-web Internet connections using a firewall. Additionally, WebSocket enables streams of messages on top of TCP. TCP alone deals with streams of bytes with no inherent concept of a message.
